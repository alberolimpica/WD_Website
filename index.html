            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <p>I am Sara Alberola, an enthusiastic web developer from Valencia, Spain.</p>
                <p>I am passionate about sewing, traveling, and learning new things.</p>
                <p>I’m looking for challenging opportunities to extend my knowledge while at the same time gathering
                    experience in my field.</p>

                    <h3>Programming</h3>
                    <p>During my university years, I did an HTML and CSS course during my free time. After that, I programmed the student's representative association web page.</p>
                    <p>Years later, during my Erasmus year, I worked during the summer developing an Android application, I enjoyed the experience so much that I decided that I wanted to work as a programmer! I started looking for web development jobs, so I moved to Madrid to pursue my dream (even though I didn't finish my studies yet). I started working as a web developer for the space industry using frameworks like GWT, Vaadin, and Spring</p>
                    <p>After finishing my degree, I started a Master's degree in Web applications development, which I will finish by the end of 2021!</p>

                    <h3>Sewing</h3>
                    <p>On my free time I like to sew.</p>
                    <p>I taught myself how to sew, but I decided to go a bit further and I decided to study and earn some certifications like BurdaStyle's Teaching Certification, BurdaStyle's Teaching Certification Advanced, and Sistema Marti's Haute Couture certification diploma </p>
